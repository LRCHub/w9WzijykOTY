Be whoever you want
I'll be whoever I want with you
You got me open, babe
But you gotta trust me too
(Trust me too)
And when you walk the town
People always stop and stare (Oh)
And I love when you come around
I'll take you everywhere,
I want you in my world
And I think about, huh
The way you make me feel
when we're alone, alone
And I think about, huh
The way the shit get real
when we get home
Girl, it's pure (Pure),
you're all I need
(You're all I need)
Girl, it's pure (Pure),
pure fantasy
What do you dream about?
Girl, it's pure
(Yeah, pure; it's pure),
you're all I need
(Baby, you're asking me)
So it's pure
(Pure, oh; it's pure),
pure fantasy (Fantasy)
Hopefully, if you dream
what I dream then
Maybe we can make
our dreams come true
Only if, you know,
you still believe in
that kind of thing
I know I do
So let me help you
And I think about, huh
The way you make me feel
when we're alone, alone (Yeah)
And I think about, huh (Your love)
The way the shit get real
when we get home
(On the way right now)
Girl, it's pure (Pure),
you're all I need (You're)
Girl, it's pure (Pure),
pure fantasy (Fantasy)
Girl, it's pure (Pure),
you're all I need
(It's all yours
what do you dream about?)
Girl, it's pure
(Just as pure as water),
pure fantasy
Girl, it's pure (Pure),
you're all I need
Girl, it's pure (Pure),
pure fantasy
